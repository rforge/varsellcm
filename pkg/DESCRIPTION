Title: Variable selection for model-based clustering using the integrated completed-data likelihood of a Latent Class Model
Description: Variable Selection for model-based clustering by using a mixture model of Gaussian distributions assuming conditional independence between variables. The algorithm carries out the model selection by optimizing the MICL criterion which has a closed form for such a distribution.
